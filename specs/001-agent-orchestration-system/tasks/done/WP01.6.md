# WP01.6: Configure Vitest testing framework

## Objective

Set up Vitest testing framework with TypeScript support, coverage reporting, and integration test configuration.

## File Paths

- `vitest.config.ts`

## Work Content

1. Create vitest.config.ts with defineConfig
2. Configure test options:
   - globals: true
   - environment: 'node'
   - coverage provider: 'v8'
   - coverage threshold: 80%
   - test directory: tests/
3. Configure TypeScript paths resolution
4. Add test timeouts for integration tests (30s)
5. Configure test reporters (default, verbose)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] vitest.config.ts exists with proper configuration
- [ ] Coverage threshold set to 80%
- [ ] Test environment set to 'node'
- [ ] TypeScript paths properly resolved
- [ ] Test timeout configured for long-running integration tests

## Dependencies

Recommended after T003 (vitest installed), but can be written independently.

## Parallel Execution

Can run in parallel with all other Phase 1 tasks (T001-T005, T007-T014).

## Unit Tests

No tests required for test framework configuration.

## Git History

**Commits**: Include [WP01.6] in commit message
