# WP01.14: Create README.md with installation and setup instructions

## Objective

Create comprehensive README documentation covering project overview, installation steps, configuration, and basic usage instructions.

## File Paths

- `README.md`

## Work Content

1. Create README.md with sections:
   - Project title and description
   - Features overview
   - Prerequisites (Node.js 20+, PostgreSQL 15+)
   - Installation steps
   - Database setup and migration instructions
   - Environment configuration
   - Running the application (dev, build, test)
   - Project structure overview
   - Contributing guidelines
   - License information
2. Include code examples for common tasks
3. Add badges for build status (placeholder)
4. Link to detailed documentation in docs/

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] README includes project description and features
- [x] Installation steps are clear and complete
- [x] Database setup instructions provided
- [x] Environment configuration documented
- [x] Running instructions for dev, build, test
- [x] Project structure documented
- [x] Links to detailed docs in specs/001-agent-orchestration-system/

## Dependencies

Recommended after all Phase 1 tasks (T001-T013) to document complete setup, but can be written in parallel.

## Parallel Execution

Can run in parallel with all other Phase 1 tasks (T001-T013).

## Unit Tests

No tests required for documentation.

## Git History

**Commits**: Include [WP01.14] in commit message
