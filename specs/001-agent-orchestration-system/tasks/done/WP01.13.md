# WP01.13: Initialize git repository and create .gitignore

## Objective

Initialize Git repository and create comprehensive .gitignore to exclude build artifacts, dependencies, and sensitive files.

## File Paths

- `.git/` (directory)
- `.gitignore`

## Work Content

1. Run `git init` to initialize repository
2. Create .gitignore with exclusions:
   ```
   # Dependencies
   node_modules/
   package-lock.json

   # Build outputs
   dist/
   build/
   *.tsbuildinfo

   # Environment
   .env
   .env.local

   # Testing
   coverage/
   .vitest/

   # Logs
   *.log
   logs/

   # IDEs
   .vscode/
   .idea/
   *.swp
   *.swo

   # OS
   .DS_Store
   Thumbs.db

   # Git worktrees (for workspace isolation)
   worktrees/
   ```
3. Verify .gitignore covers all sensitive and generated files
4. Create initial commit with setup files

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] .gitignore excludes node_modules, dist, .env
- [ ] .gitignore includes worktrees/ for agent workspaces
- [ ] All build artifacts and logs excluded
- [ ] IDE and OS files excluded

## Dependencies

Can run independently or after other Phase 1 tasks are complete.

## Parallel Execution

Can run in parallel with all other Phase 1 tasks (T001-T012, T014).

## Unit Tests

No tests required for Git initialization.

## Git History

**Commits**: Include [WP01.13] in commit message
