# WP01.11: Setup development scripts in package.json

## Objective

Configure npm scripts for common development tasks including building, testing, linting, and running the application.

## File Paths

- `package.json` (scripts section)

## Work Content

1. Add scripts to package.json:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "tsx watch src/index.ts",
       "build": "tsc",
       "start": "node dist/index.js",
       "test": "vitest run",
       "test:watch": "vitest",
       "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
       "lint": "eslint src tests --ext .ts",
       "lint:fix": "eslint src tests --ext .ts --fix",
       "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.ts\" \"tests/**/*.ts\"",
       "migrate": "tsx src/database/migrate.ts",
       "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"
     }
   }
   ```
2. Verify all scripts reference correct files and commands
3. Test each script runs without errors

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] dev script starts development server with watch mode
- [ ] build script compiles TypeScript to dist/
- [ ] test scripts run Vitest with coverage option
- [ ] lint scripts check and fix code quality
- [ ] format script applies Prettier formatting
- [ ] migrate script runs database migrations
- [ ] typecheck validates TypeScript without building

## Dependencies

Recommended after T001 (package.json exists), but can be done independently.

## Parallel Execution

Can run in parallel with other Phase 1 tasks (T001-T010, T012-T014).

## Unit Tests

No tests required for npm scripts configuration.

## Git History

**Commits**: Include [WP01.11] in commit message
