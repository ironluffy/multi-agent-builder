# WP01.3: Install core dependencies

## Objective

Install all core runtime and development dependencies required for the agent orchestration system.

## File Paths

- `package.json` (updated with dependencies)
- `package-lock.json`

## Work Content

1. Install core dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk pg uuid zod pino
   ```
2. Install dev dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install -D typescript @types/node @types/pg vitest tsx
   ```
3. Verify package.json contains all required dependencies
4. Verify package-lock.json is generated

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] @anthropic-ai/sdk installed for Claude API access
- [ ] pg (PostgreSQL client) installed
- [ ] uuid, zod, pino installed
- [ ] TypeScript and type definitions installed as dev dependencies
- [ ] package-lock.json generated

## Dependencies

Recommended after T001 (package.json exists), but can run independently.

## Parallel Execution

Can run in parallel with other Phase 1 tasks (T002, T004-T014).

## Unit Tests

No tests required for dependency installation.

## Git History

**Commits**: Include [WP01.3] in commit message
