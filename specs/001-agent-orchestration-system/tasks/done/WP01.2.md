# WP01.2: Configure TypeScript 5.3.3 with strict mode in tsconfig.json

## Objective

Set up TypeScript configuration with strict mode enabled, ES2022 target, and proper module resolution for Node.js project.

## File Paths

- `tsconfig.json`

## Work Content

1. Create tsconfig.json with strict mode enabled
2. Configure compiler options:
   - target: "ES2022"
   - module: "ES2022"
   - moduleResolution: "bundler"
   - strict: true
   - esModuleInterop: true
   - skipLibCheck: true
   - forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: true
3. Set include/exclude paths (src/, tests/)
4. Configure output directory to dist/

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] tsconfig.json exists with strict: true
- [ ] Target and module set to ES2022
- [ ] Output directory configured to dist/
- [ ] Include paths cover src/ and tests/

## Dependencies

None - can run in parallel with T001.

## Parallel Execution

Can run in parallel with all other Phase 1 tasks (T001, T003-T014).

## Unit Tests
