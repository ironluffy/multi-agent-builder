# WP02.15: Create Workspace model interface [P]

## Objective

Define the TypeScript interface for the Workspace model, supporting Git worktree-based workspace isolation for parallel agent development.

## File Paths

- `src/models/Workspace.ts`

## Work Content

1. Create Workspace.ts with interface definition:
   ```typescript
   export enum WorkspaceStatus {
     ACTIVE = 'active',
     MERGED = 'merged',
     ABANDONED = 'abandoned',
     CLEANUP_PENDING = 'cleanup_pending'
   }

   export interface Workspace {
     id: string;
     agent_id: string;
     worktree_path: string;
     branch_name: string;
     isolation_status: WorkspaceStatus;
     created_at: Date;
     merged_at?: Date;
     cleaned_up_at?: Date;
     metadata?: Record<string, any>;
   }

   export interface CreateWorkspaceInput {
     agent_id: string;
     branch_name: string;
   }
   ```
2. Add JSDoc documentation
3. Export type guards for status validation
4. Export helper types for workspace operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workspace interface matches database schema
- [ ] WorkspaceStatus enum matches database enum
- [ ] All fields properly typed
- [ ] CreateWorkspaceInput helper type exported
- [ ] JSDoc comments on interface

## Dependencies

Depends on T015 (database schema), T019 (Workspace table specification).

## Parallel Execution

[P] Can run in parallel with other model interfaces (T026-T028, T030-T031).

## Unit Tests

Type checking validated through TypeScript compiler. No runtime tests required.
