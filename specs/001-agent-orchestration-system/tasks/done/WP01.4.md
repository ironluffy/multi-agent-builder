# WP01.4: Create project directory structure

## Objective

Establish the standard project directory structure for organizing source code, tests, database migrations, and configuration files.

## File Paths

- `src/`
- `src/core/`
- `src/services/`
- `src/database/`
- `src/database/repositories/`
- `src/models/`
- `src/infrastructure/`
- `src/config/`
- `src/utils/`
- `tests/`
- `tests/integration/`
- `tests/unit/`
- `migrations/`
- `config/`
- `docs/`

## Work Content

1. Create main directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/{core,services,database/repositories,models,infrastructure,config,utils}
   mkdir -p tests/{integration,unit}
   mkdir -p migrations config docs
   ```
2. Create placeholder .gitkeep files in empty directories
3. Verify structure matches plan.md organization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All src/ subdirectories created
- [ ] tests/integration and tests/unit directories exist
- [ ] migrations/ directory exists for database schema
- [ ] config/ directory exists for configuration files
- [ ] docs/ directory exists for documentation

## Dependencies

None - independent setup task.

## Parallel Execution

Can run in parallel with all other Phase 1 tasks (T001-T003, T005-T014).

## Unit Tests

No tests required for directory creation.

## Git History

**Commits**: Include [WP01.4] in commit message
