# WP01.9: Initialize structured logging with Pino

## Objective

Set up Pino logger with structured logging, configurable log levels, and proper serialization for production use.

## File Paths

- `src/utils/Logger.ts`

## Work Content

1. Create Logger.ts with Pino import
2. Configure Pino logger with:
   - Log level from environment config
   - Pretty printing in development
   - JSON output in production
   - Error serialization
   - Request ID support
3. Create child logger factory for context-specific logging
4. Export singleton logger instance
5. Add helper methods: debug, info, warn, error, fatal

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Pino logger configured with environment-based log level
- [ ] Pretty printing enabled in development
- [ ] JSON output for production
- [ ] Child logger factory for contextual logging
- [ ] Error objects properly serialized

## Dependencies

Recommended after T003 (pino installed) and T008 (env config), but can be written independently.

## Parallel Execution

Can run in parallel with other Phase 1 tasks (T001-T008, T010-T014).

## Unit Tests

Unit test in tests/unit/utils/Logger.test.ts for log output verification.

## Git History

**Commits**: Include [WP01.9] in commit message
