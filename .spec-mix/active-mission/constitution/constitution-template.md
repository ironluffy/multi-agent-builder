# Project Constitution: [PROJECT NAME]

## Core Principles

### 1. Code Quality

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code

- Follow established coding conventions and style guides

- Prioritize clarity over cleverness

### 2. Testing Standards

- All new features must include tests

- Maintain high test coverage (aim for >80%)

- Test edge cases and error conditions

- Write tests that document expected behavior

### 3. User Experience

- Design with the end user in mind

- Ensure consistency across the application

- Provide clear error messages and feedback

- Make interfaces intuitive and accessible

### 4. Performance Requirements

- Optimize for common use cases

- Profile before optimizing

- Document performance-critical sections

- Balance performance with maintainability

### 5. Documentation

- Document public APIs and interfaces

- Include examples in documentation

- Keep README up-to-date

- Document architectural decisions

### 6. Security

- Validate all user inputs

- Follow security best practices

- Keep dependencies up-to-date

- Review code for vulnerabilities

### 7. Collaboration

- Write descriptive commit messages

- Review code carefully and constructively

- Communicate decisions and trade-offs

- Share knowledge with the team

## Development Workflow

1. **Specification**: Define what needs to be built

2. **Planning**: Create technical implementation plan

3. **Implementation**: Build with tests

4. **Review**: Peer review code and tests

5. **Integration**: Merge to main branch

6. **Deployment**: Release to users

## Quality Gates

Before merging to main:
- [ ] All tests passing

- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

- [ ] Documentation updated

- [ ] No known critical bugs

- [ ] Performance requirements met

## Decision-Making Framework

When faced with technical choices:

1. Consider impact on users first

2. Evaluate maintainability

3. Assess performance implications

4. Review security considerations

5. Document the decision and rationale
